    <h2>Our Projects</h2>
    <h2>Transforming Lives Across Nigeria</h2>
<p>At RAHAMA Girl Child and Women Empowerment Initiative, our journey over the years has been marked by steadfast commitment, bold action, and unwavering passion to improve the health and wellbeing of Nigeria’s most vulnerable populations. With a vision to break down barriers and create equal opportunities, we have built a legacy of community empowerment, health system strengthening, and sustained social change.<p>

<h2> Reaching Across Four States and 234 Settlements </h2>
<p> Our work spans four states in Nigeria, reaching deeply into 234 settlements—from bustling urban centers to remote rural villages. This expansive geographic footprint is a testament to our dedication to inclusivity and equity, ensuring that no community is left behind regardless of location or circumstance.

Every settlement we work in is a community of individuals with unique challenges, aspirations, and stories. We listen closely, work hand in hand with community leaders, and tailor our programs to meet the specific needs of adolescents, women, children, and other vulnerable groups. By doing so, we foster trust, build local capacity, and ignite sustainable change from the ground up.<p>

<h2> Impacting Over 6 Million Lives </h2>
Over the years, our projects have touched the lives of more than six million people across diverse populations. Whether it’s adolescent girls gaining access to life-saving HIV services, families benefiting from improved tuberculosis treatment options, or communities embracing health literacy and preventive care — the scale and depth of our impact continue to grow.

<p> Our work is not just about numbers; it’s about real stories of transformation. Girls empowered to stay in school, mothers confident in their ability to care for their children’s health, communities equipped with the tools to monitor and demand better services — these are the powerful outcomes that define RAHAMA’s mission in action.<p>

<h2> Partnership: A Cornerstone of Our Success</h2>
<p>We recognize that meaningful and lasting change is a collective effort. That’s why we cultivate strong partnerships with a range of esteemed global and local stakeholders. Our collaborations with donors such as the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Unitaid through Treatment Action Group (TAG), Médecins Du Monde, and the European Union Civil Protection have been vital in scaling our reach and deepening our impact.

Beyond funding, these partnerships bring expertise, innovation, and shared vision — enabling us to implement cutting-edge interventions, influence policy, and advocate for the rights and health of marginalized populations. Together, we champion a Nigeria where every adolescent, woman, and child has access to quality healthcare and the opportunity to thrive.<p>

<h2> Community-Driven and Data-Informed Approaches</h2>
<p> Central to our work is a commitment to community leadership and evidence-based programming. We empower local communities to take ownership of their health and wellbeing through community-led monitoring and engagement in virtual spaces. This participatory approach ensures programs are responsive and rooted in lived experiences.

Simultaneously, we harness data to inform decisions, advocate for policy change, and continuously improve service delivery. By leveraging technology and strategic partnerships, we make sure that the voices of those we serve guide the development and scaling of effective health interventions.</p>

      <h3>About ASCENT DR-TB Project</h3>
      <p>Funded by Unitaid through Treatment Action Group (TAG), this 9-month initiative (October 2024 – July 2025) is focused on transforming the fight against drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in Kano State, Nigeria. Our goal is to improve access to shorter, safer, and more effective treatment regimens by empowering communities and driving policy advocacy for the scale-up of BPaL/M therapies across the country by June 2025.</p>
      <p> Our Approach is by adopting a community-led model, we place the power to influence treatment access and quality directly in the hands of those most affected. Through targeted advocacy, we work to accelerate policy changes that enable wider availability of innovative DR-TB regimens, ensuring more patients receive the care they urgently need.

This project embodies a commitment to making life-saving treatments more accessible, improving health outcomes, and ultimately reducing the burden of DR-TB in Kano State and beyond.

      <h3>About AYP Project</h3>
      <p> Supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), this 12-months initiative is dedicated to transforming HIV service delivery for Adolescents and Young People (AYP) in Kano State, Nigeria. Our goal is to enhance community-led monitoring and boost engagement in virtual spaces to ensure young people have better access to, and quality of, HIV services.</p>
    <p>We are committed to empowering Adolescents and Young People with vital knowledge about HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and care—helping them make informed decisions about their health and futures.

At the heart of the project is strengthening community-led monitoring mechanisms through innovative technology, enabling local communities to actively track and improve HIV service delivery. This approach ensures that the voices of young people are heard and that services meet their specific needs.

We also prioritize the strategic use of data to drive change. By leveraging technology to collect and analyze information, we support evidence-based decision-making at both national and subnational levels. This empowers policymakers and stakeholders to adapt and improve HIV programs, delivering more effective services to the youth of Kano State.</p>
