      <h3>AYP Project</h3>
      <p> Supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), this 12-months initiative is dedicated to transforming HIV service delivery for Adolescents and Young People (AYP) in Kano State, Nigeria. Our goal is to enhance community-led monitoring and boost engagement in virtual spaces to ensure young people have better access to, and quality of, HIV services.</p>
    <p>We are committed to empowering Adolescents and Young People with vital knowledge about HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and careâ€”helping them make informed decisions about their health and futures.

At the heart of the project is strengthening community-led monitoring mechanisms through innovative technology, enabling local communities to actively track and improve HIV service delivery. This approach ensures that the voices of young people are heard and that services meet their specific needs.

We also prioritize the strategic use of data to drive change. By leveraging technology to collect and analyze information, we support evidence-based decision-making at both national and subnational levels. This empowers policymakers and stakeholders to adapt and improve HIV programs, delivering more effective services to the youth of Kano State.</p>
