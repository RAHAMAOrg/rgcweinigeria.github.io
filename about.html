  <!-- Story Text -->
  <div class="story-text">
        <div class="story-paragraph">
          <p class="story-opening">There was a woman who used to plait our hair.</p>
          
          <p>She worked for hours each day, fingers moving tirelessly, using that small income to care for her children. Her husband did not work, so the responsibility of survival rested entirely on her shoulders. She carried it quietly—feeding her family, meeting daily needs, showing up no matter how tired she was.</p>
          
          <p class="emphasis-text">She was resilient, but resilience came at a cost.</p>
          
          <p>She loved English. Whenever she heard us speak it, her face lit up. She would repeat words carefully, laughing softly, always saying how she wished she could speak English confidently too. To her, English represented more than language—it represented voice, confidence, and being taken seriously in the world.</p>
          
          <p>But alongside her strength and dreams was fear.</p>
          
          <p>She spoke often about childbirth and her belief that she could not stop giving birth. Not because she wanted more children, but because she was afraid. Afraid that stopping might mean denying the world a child who could become someone important, a governor, a leader, someone who might one day help her escape hardship.</p>
          
          <p class="emphasis-text">That fear did not come from ignorance alone. It came from lack of access, access to information, healthcare, choice, and reassurance that her life and body mattered too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-reflection">
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Why must women suffer endlessly just to be considered strong? Why must girls' dreams disappear so early?"</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="reflection-text"><strong> That question became the foundation of RAHAMA!</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-mission">
          <p><strong>RAHAMA meaning mercy and compassion</strong>exists to ensure that girls and women are not forced to choose between fear and survival. We work to empower girls and women with the voice to define their own futures, the knowledge to make informed choices, and the support to reach their full potential.</p>
          
          <p>Through access to education, healthcare, sexual and reproductive health information, livelihoods, and community engagement, RAHAMA addresses the barriers that quietly limit women's lives. We believe empowerment is not just about resilience, it is about choice, dignity, and opportunity.</p>
          
          <p class="story-closing"><strong>RAHAMA was founded so that girls can grow up knowing they can be whatever they choose. So that women do not have to carry the weight of the world alone. So that dreams—spoken softly while plaiting hair can become lived realities!!!.</strong></p>
          
          <p class="final-statement">This is why RAHAMA exists. And this is the future we are building—together.</p>
