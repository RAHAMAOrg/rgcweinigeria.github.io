      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 4th June 2018</p>

      <p>Rahama Girl Child and Women Empowerment Initiative (RAHAMA) is a non-profit organization established by a group of young activists dedicated to promoting equality and human rights across Nigeria. Our mission is to support and empower vulnerable women, youth, and children.</p>

We partner with government bodies, international NGOs, community-based organizations, and grassroots groups to ensure sustainable development and empowerment.</p>
